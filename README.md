# TMC2130 Breakout Board PCB design files

TMC2130 (Trinamic) Breakout board for 3D printer upgrade to SPI mode.

This was inspired by [other's](https://github.com/bladykast/TMC2130-SPI-PCB) incredible work who did something [similar](https://github.com/carlcalderon/TMC2130-Breakout-Board), but with the goal to familiarize myself with PCB design softwares on Linux.

So I used [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org) to design those.
